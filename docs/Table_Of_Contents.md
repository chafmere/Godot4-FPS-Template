Welcome to Godot's First Person Shooter Template.

This Template puts a lot of emphasis on the "S" in FPS. As most other FPS templates seem to focus more on the movement and feel. This template does not have a lot of fancy juice. But what it does aim to be is a functional and practicle template that will allow you to quickly create a FPS game in godot. Which will allow you to prototype quickly without having to worry about setting up the shooting mechanics which players have come to expect in FPS games. 

It can also be a great learning tool if you want to learn more about signals and components as the manager leans heavily into using both.

Here is some information on how the various components work together to create an FPS game

1. [Creating A New Weapon](Creating_A_New_Weapon.md)

2. [How Projectiles Work](Projectiles_To_Load.md)

3. [Creating a Spray Profile](Spray_Profile.md)

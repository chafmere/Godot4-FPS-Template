Welcome to Godot's First Person Shooter Template.

This template puts a lot of emphasis on the "S" in FPS. While most other FPS templates seem to focus more on movement and feel, this template does not have a lot of fancy juice. However, it aims to be a functional and practical template that will allow you to quickly create an FPS game in Godot. This will enable you to prototype quickly without having to worry about setting up the shooting mechanics, which players have come to expect in FPS games.

It can also be a great learning tool if you want to learn more about signals and components, as the manager leans heavily into using both.

Here is some information on how the various components work together to create an FPS game:

1. [Creating A New Weapon](Creating_A_New_Weapon.md)

2. [How Projectiles Work](Projectiles_To_Load.md)

3. [Creating a Spray Profile](Spray_Profile.md)

4. [How Picking Up and Dropping Weapons Work](Weapon_Drop_&_Pick_Ups.md)

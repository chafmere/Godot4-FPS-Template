Are you a game developer looking for a free FPS template for Godot 4? With basic shooting mechanics and movement controls, this template provides a great starting point for your own FPS game.

I used resources to define each weapon and a state machine that controls which weapon resource the controller is using, the rest is just animation and stats. I've been able to swap out the default with a normal FPS rig in 10 minutes. The idea being that this can be used to rapid prototype a game and if you wanted to add in weapons/animations it's just a matter of creating them in blender or in godot itself.

I also try to make regular videos to show what I've been doing behind the scenes on my Feel free to pop on over and check out some of those videos. Maybe even like and subscribe!
